Notes on South db migrations:
- Only apps that have gone through some development time have been converted
  to south. Since there may be some large upheavals still, the conversion for 
  the baseline of these apps can wait till they've been more properly "vetted"

- The following fixtures will need migrated when a model change causes a schema
	change in the apps listed below each:
	- events/fixtures/initial_data:
		* events
	- fixtures/all_imported_* (oldsite-events-handling branch only)
	    * events, places, identity, outsourcing

-------------------

!!!!!! oldsite-events-handling branch notes !!!!!!!

This branch exists for the benefit of importing new events to the old site.
While the new codebase is being developed. This should be the only branch
ever checked out on the old site's production server.

It is safe to use this code to update data for display on the old site. (e.g.
the scripts import_icalevents, import_fbpages, etc.)

Differences between this branch and master:
- oldevents app: An data schema that's frozen in time from back in December. 
	All events added prior to 12/14/2011 are stored in a fixture that is 
	compatiable with this schema (oldevents/fixtures/oldsite_events.json.gz)

	To build an old site compatable database from this code and attached
	fixtures:
	1. Create database with utf8 character set
	2. ./manage syncdb
	3. ./manage loaddata oldsite_events
	4. At this point, any other means necessary to add new events. e.g. ./manage loaddata <fixture file>
 
- fixture files and logs:
 	These are saved fixtures/logs from previous imports. Should be timestamped.
 	.gitignore file is edited to track these logs.

- php folder: This folder contains PHP code to work with the old Wordpress
	site. This code should be updated anytime there is a schema change to any
	of the following models:
	* from Places: Place, Location
	* from Events: Event, Role, Attendee
	* from Identity: Identity, Organization

	This code should be copied to the appropriate places in the WP site code.
