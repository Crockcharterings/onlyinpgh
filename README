NOTE: DEVELOPMENT ON ALL BRANCHES OF THIS REPOSITORY EXCEPT FOR (except for 
oldsite-event-handling) HAS BEEN SUSPENDED UNTIL THE OBID APP IS COMPLETE.

After completion of the Obid app, it is likely that this repository will be 
completely refactored and replaced. At the very least, changes from the 
"forked" obidapp repository will be merged back in.

-----------------

Notes on South db migrations:
- Only apps that have gone through some development time have been converted
  to south. Since there may be some large upheavals still, the conversion for 
  the baseline of these apps can wait till they've been more properly "vetted"

- The following fixtures will need migrated when a model change causes a schema
	change in the apps listed below each:
	- events/fixtures/initial_data:
		* events
